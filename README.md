- 👋  Hi, I’m Manas Anand, a December 2023 grad from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I majored in Mathematics & Computer Science. I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Sprout Social](https://www.sproutsocial.com). 

- ⏰ I've previously interned at  [BlackEdge Capital](https://www.blackedge.com/), [JPMorgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), and [AbbVie Inc](https://www.abbvie.com/) as a software engineer.

- 👀  I’m interested in distributed systems, algorithms, and discrete mathematics.

- 🌱  I’m currently learning about distributed systems, real analysis, and numerical analysis. I am a self proclaimed cinephile and enjoy listening to alternative rock and hip-hop mustic (do you recognize my profile picture?).

- 📫  Feel free to reach out to me at manasa3@illinois.edu
