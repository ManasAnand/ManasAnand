- 👋  Hi, I’m Manas Anand, a senior at UIUC studying CS + Mathematics graduating in December 2023. Currently looking for any New Grad roles in the quantitative trading and software fields.

- ⏰ I've previously interned at  [BlackEdge Capital](https://www.blackedge.com/), [JPMorgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), and [AbbVie Inc](https://www.abbvie.com/) as a software engineer.

- 👀  I’m interested in low-latency algorithmic trading systems, algorithms, and discrete mathematics.

- 🌱  I’m currently learning about distributed systems, real analysis, and numerical analysis. I am a self proclaimed cinephile and enjoy listening to alternative rock and hip-hop mustic (do you recognize my profile picture?).

- 📫  Feel free to reach out to me at manasa3@illinois.edu
